                 <p>Mahabali, also known as Bali, Indrasenan, or Maveli, was a daitya king featured in Hinduism. He was the grandson of Prahlada,
                     and a descendant of the sage Kashyapa. He was a righteous and charitable man and treated all his subjects equally. There was 
                     no poverty, crime or cruelty during his rule. His rule was likened to the golden era as everyone was happy and there was no
                    discrimination on the basis of caste or class</p><br> <p>Mahabali also temporarily possessed the amrita (nectar of eternal life)
                     obtained by the asuras. The amrita allowed his subjects to bring him back to life after his death in one of the wars 
                     between suras (devas) and asuras. Mahabali was, thus, immune from death. After many wars, the invincible Bali had 
                    conquered heaven and earth. The suras (devas) approached Vishnu to save them from complete obliteration. Vishnu refused 
                      to join the war, or outright kill his own devotee Mahabali. To restore the natural order, he incarnated as the dwarf Brahmin 
                      avatar, Vamanal</p><br> <p>While Mahabali was performing the ashvamedha sacrifice to celebrate his victories and giving away 
                    gifts to everyone, Vamana approached him and requested “three steps of land”. Mahabali granted him this gift, despite
                  warnings from Shukra, who had realised Vamana’s true identity. Vamana then metamorphosed into Vishnu’s colossal 
                     trivikrama form, the first foot encompassing all of heaven in one step and the earth with the second foot. When
                rhetorically asked where he might take his promised third step, Mahabali accepted his fate and offered his own head.
                Satisfied by the king’s devotion, Lord Vishnu blessed Mahabali and sent him to Pathala or the netherworld, with
                  permission to visit his subjects once every year</p><br> <p>The place where this incident is believed to have taken 
                 place was given the name Trikalkkara which was later changed to Thrikkakara. The incident is said to have occurred
                 on the star sign of Thiruvonam in the month of Chingam, and ever since, every year during the 10 days of Onam,
                  the people of Kerala eagerly await their beloved king. The tale of Mahabali’s sacrifice as described in the
                  folk song “Maveli nadu vaneedum kalam” is associated with Onam</p><br> <p>In Kerala, King Mahabali is considered to be the noblest and most 
                prosperous ruler, who transformed his kingdom into a heavenly place. His legend is a major part of the annual festival Onam in the state of
             Kerala, and Balipratipada (the fourth day of Deepavali and first day of Kartika month) festival in North India and Tulunadu1 In Hinduism, 
             Mahabali is considered one of the Chiranjivi, a group of seven immortals. It is believed that he will become the King of Svarga (heaven) in the next yugal</p>
